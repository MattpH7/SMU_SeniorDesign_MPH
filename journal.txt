Journal Entry #1: 3/1/2019
1. Briefly describe your project. (About 2 sentences.)
  I would be assisting the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board with their development and testing needs.
  The major project they have been working on is the LEAF data systems with MJ Freeway. 
  This software tracks marijuana from seed-to-sale and is used for manifests and tracking producers, processors and retailers in the marijuana business in Washington state. 
  
2. What is your particular role in the project?
  My role will not be established until I start working on the project. 
  I know the lead developer and I would be assisting him their software development needs.

3. What have you done personally in the two weeks leading up to Feb. 24?
  I have reached out to the LCB and made contact with the project manager of the development team. 
  
4. Describe any significant progress made by the team as a whole in this time period.
  After making contact, I was told to check in with them when the semester nears its end so I will be able to participate full-time with their projects.
